==========================
- For Call of War game management, describe your problem, retrieve your userID from Call of War (select via profile), copy gameID, and paste it to my DMs for reporting.
- For War Thunder: Partnerships, my DMs are open. If it's for gaming, you can request my username for your intended game if needed.
- For the League of Servers, Aces, or just any server I'm in management; I do apologize for any delays in responses, as University is here. If you can't reach out to me or if I don't respond in 30 minutes or less, message any of the Secretariat or any other high command for your concerns. Thank you!
- For anything else; don't spam server invites in my DMs unprovoked.
